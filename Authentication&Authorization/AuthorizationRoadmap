This should be the roadmap for preparing for the Authorization :
* Role-based vs Policy-based.
* Claim-based
* Identity vs Principle
* Session vs Token-based
* Stateless vs Stateful Authorization
* OAuth2
* Cookies
* OpenID
* SAML
* What is Token forwarding
* What is RBAC
* What is Multi tenancy



Try creating some system design requirements: 

**Design a scalable authentication system
* Question focus: Handling millions of users, load balancing, session vs. token management, security, MFA, third-party login (Google/Facebook), database scalability, and caching 

** Multi-tenant SaaS Authentication & RBAC
* Question focus: Handling multiple tenants (tenantId isolation), using JWT or refresh tokens, managing roles (Admin/Editor/Viewer), OAuth integration, session revocation 

** Authentication for Microservices
*Question: Design auth for microservices at scale. Use a centralized identity provider, OAuth/OIDC, API Gateway, token-based auth, RBAC, and stateless session management 
.
** Question: How would you secure communication between services?
Look at OAuth 2.0/OIDC, JWT for tokens, TLS encryption, role/attribute-based access control, auditing, and service mesh


Then later :

Implement using Azure 
Other open source
